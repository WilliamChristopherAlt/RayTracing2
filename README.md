Please install a compiler and link it in task.json in order to run this project in vscode.

The main working space is very cluttered and disjointed, but it is essentially setting up OpenGL environment, loading models and materials, currently you can do the following things:
  1. Use Mouse/WASD/Mouse wheel to: Look/Move/Zoom around.
  2. Ctrl+S to take screen shot
  1. Change OBJ models path
  2. Change containing box(classic cornell box, or something more exotic like full mirrors everywhere?)
  3. Change render resolution, cornell light intensity, number of samples and frames for screenshot for high quality offline rendering (WARNING: Due to my bad understanding of resources management in C++, high quality screen shot will most likely take a long time to render and will slow down your computer)
  4.
